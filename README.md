# dotfiles
My Mac dotfiles

## differences between mac/linux
Pretty much everything.

## Installation
Same as Linux.

## notes
prezto is slightly buggy (i.e. agnoster isn't working)

lots of aliases set to my home, change them to yours (sorry)

base-16 eighties is what I use as a color scheme (https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2)
